# python-week4-plp

This code defines the Person class with the `__init__` method to initialize the `name`, `age`, and `gender` attributes. It also defines the introduce method that prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.

After defining the class, the code creates an instance of the Person class with the name "John Doe", age 30, and gender "Male". It then calls the introduce method to display the person's information.

When you run this code, it will output:


#`Hello, my name is John Doe. I am 30 years old and my gender is Male.`
